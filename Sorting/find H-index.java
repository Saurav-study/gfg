// You are given an array citations[], where each element citations[i] represents the number of citations received by the ith paper of a researcher. You have to calculate the researcherâ€™s H-index.
// The H-index is defined as the maximum value H, such that the researcher has published at least H papers, and all those papers have citation value greater than or equal to H.

// Examples:

// Input: citations[] = [3, 0, 5, 3, 0]
// Output: 3
// Explanation: There are at least 3 papers with citation counts of 3, 5, and 3, all having citations greater than or equal to 3.
